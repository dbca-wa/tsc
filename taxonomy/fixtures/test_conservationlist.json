(1992) - A major revision of Version 1.0, including numerical criteria appropriate to all organisms and introducing the non-threatened categories.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1: IUCN (1993) - Following an extensive consultation process within SSC, a number of changes were made to the details of the criteria, and fuller explanation of basic principles was included. A more explicit structure clarified the significance of the non-threatened categories.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.2: Mace and Stuart (1994) - Following further comments received and additional validation exercises, some minor changes to the criteria were made. In addition, the Susceptible category present in Versions 2.0 and 2.1 was subsumed into the Vulnerable category. A precautionary application of the system was emphasised.\r\n\r\nFinal Version - This final document, which incorporates changes as a result of comments from IUCN members, was adopted by the IUCN Council in December 1994.",
