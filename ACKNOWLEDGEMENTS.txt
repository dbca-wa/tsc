The Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) respectfully acknowledges Aboriginal people as the traditional owners of the lands and waters it manages.

One of the Department's core missions is to conserve and protect the value of the land to the culture and heritage of Aboriginal people.

This software was created for the primary purpose of conserving the biodiversity of Western Australia, and in doing so, caring for country.

The author would especially like to acknowledge the contributions of Dr. Robert I.T. Prince, who provided guidance and advice based on his more than 40 years of experience in biodiversity conservation with the Department and its predecessors.
