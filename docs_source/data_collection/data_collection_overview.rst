All you need to know is written at :ref:`data-collection-training`,
but feel free to read more of this documentation.

Are you a data collection admin in charge of maintaining collection devices
(tablets), training data collectors, and uploading the data?
Read :ref:`data-collection-admin`.


Are you a solution architect, developer or business analyst? Then read on.

Solution architecture and infrastructure
========================================

This section provides a condensed overview of the information management infrastructure behind our digital data collection process.

* Forms are built using the form builder software
  `ODK Build <https://opendatakit.org/use/build/>`_,
  hosted `here <http://build.opendatakit.org/>`_.
* Forms are pushed from ODK Build to an instance of the data
  clearinghouse software
  `ODK Aggregate <https://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/>`_,
  deployed `here <http://dpaw-data.appspot.com/>`_.
* Mobile Android devices (tablets, phablets, smartphones) running
  the data collection software
  `ODK Collect <https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/>`_
  are configured to load data collection forms from
  `DBCA's ODK Aggregate server <http://dpaw-data.appspot.com/>`_,
  collect data (offline capable), and submit collected data back to
  DBCA's ODK Aggregate server.
* The data manager (Florian Mayer) uploads data from DBCA's
  ODK Aggregate server to the WA Sea Turtle Database
  `WAStD <https://tsc.dpaw.wa.gov.au/>`_.
* Data anlysts access the WAStD API e.g. using the R package
  `wastdR <https://parksandwildlife.github.io/wastdr/>`_ to produce insight
  from the collected data.
* Insight is disseminated through the
  `DBCA data catalogue <https://data.dpaw.wa.gov.au/>`_ and other internal or public platforms.

Lessons learnt from paper-based field data collection
=====================================================

Scenario 1: Two tags applied, both tags recorded incorrectly
------------------------------------------------------------
One turtle is encountered in two subsequent nights by two separate teams.

Night 1
^^^^^^^
* Data entry operators "Tim" and "Natalie" were in a rush, tagged turtle with tag "WB7326", but
  recorded next tag "WB7330" on tag dispenser as "applied new".
* Operators grabbed a PIT tag "900006000144755" from bag and applied it to turtle,
  then went back to the bag, mistook another empty PIT package of tag
  "900006000143470" (hint: with a few missing ID stickers - missing means peeled
  off by sand, or stuck onto another datasheet when applied to a turtle)
  for the package of the just applied tag "...755" and recorded "...470" incorrectly
  as "applied new".
* Team 1 measure CCL

Night 2
^^^^^^^
* Second team "Spud" and "Coral" encounter the same turtle with left flipper tag
 "WB7326"
* They scan for PIT tag, find and record "...755"
* They apply and record another flipper tag "WB7384" on right flipper
* They measure CCL and CCW

The aftermath
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Team leader "Spud" wants to lookup tag history "WB7326", suspecting the turtle
  might originate from different nesting location, based on the fact that the
  turtle was already tagged. Most likely, seeing a tagged turtle this early in the
  tagging season means that the tag has been applied elswhere earlier.
* The tag is not in the tagging database. This is unexpected.
* Data curator realises that the tag is from the tag series allocated to the current
  field trip. This means that the tag must have been applied new within the past
  days, and the corresponding datasheet must be present in the field office.
* Data curator spends the next half hour manically trying to find the datasheet
  referencing the application of tag "WB7326".
* Data curator questions correctness of first datasheet's tag ID.
* Day 1's datasheet is the only potentially matching candidate with similarities
  to day 2's datasheet: CCL within 3mm, one tag on front left flipper.
* Data curator decides that at least one of two datasheets is incorrect.
* Data curator locates "WB7330" in one of the tagging backpacks. This means that
  datasheet 1's flipper tag ID must be incorrect.
* Data curator infers based on similar body length and position of single flipper
  tag, datasheet 1 and 2 refer to the same turtle, and corrects the tag ID on
  datasheet 1 to "WB7326".
* Data curator learns from "Natalie" that the empty PIT tag box had only two
  remaining stickers out of five left. This indicates that the recorded PIT tag ID
  on datasheet 1 is also incorrect. The curator therefore assumes that the PIT
  tag ID of datasheet 2 is correct and adjusts datasheet 1 to report PIT tag ID
  "...755".

Lessons learnt from mobile field data collection
================================================

The choice of methodology can be driven by time availability.

Example: Teams are dropped off on remote beaches and have too little time to
identify and individually record turtle tracks (on paper or on mobile).
In this case, a tally was kept on paper forms, as no specialised mobile app for
tally observations was available yet. Now such a form has been built.


.. _geolocation-and-wifi:

GPS location and WiFi
=====================
Android devices can set the location mode (System settings) to use WiFi + network + GPS, WiFi + network only, or GPS only.

A particularity of the guest WiFi network used for all tablets on DBCA campuses is that this WiFi network
does NOT provide a geolocation at all. If a tablet is therefore set to location mode "WiFi + GPS" and used
indoors (no GPS signal), the ODK Collect geolocation will time out on (not) getting a location estimate
from the guest WiFi at DBCA. This problem does not exist with other WiFi networks we tested.

Therefore, all training must happen outdoors. The location mode can be set to "WiFi + GPS" or "GPS only", but
tablets must have a clear view of the sky.

All devices get a good GPS signal on beaches outside of WiFi range, independent on location mode.

This insight was derived from testing devices in the field (beaches from Ningaloo, Karratha to Broome)
and DBCA offices (Exmouth, Karratha, Broome, Perth) and non-DBCA locations over seveal months.

General observations
--------------------
* All devices were daylight-readable.
* Screen protectors, especially the non-sticky plastic sheets from rugged cases,
  tend to decrease the contrast a bit.
* Polarising sunglasses and (polarised) device screens cancel each other out
  at certain angles, so that the display appears to blacken.
* All devices had sufficient battery life to support hours of data collection.
* Operation in harsh environments was against expectations no problem:
  walking along sandy beaches in daylight, sweaty fingers, flying sand.
* Large devices in rugged cases in full sun can overheat to the point of auto-shutdown.
  Hold them in your own shade when operating and out of the sun when not.
* External battery packs extend time between wall power charging.
* Best low-cost field device: Lenovo Tab 3. Runner-up: Samsung S2 8".
* Strong case against Galaxy Tab A (slow GPS, low internal storage,
  old OS version) and of course devices without GPS chip.


.. _cost-benefit-analysis-digital-data-capture:

Cost-benefit analysis for digital data collection
=================================================
Digital data collection provides systematic advantages over paper-based
data collection, as it skips several work-intensive, error-prone steps
in the data life cycle.

Paper-based data collection
---------------------------

Filling in a paper data sheet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Error sources: typos, illegible or rushed handwriting, invalid values, fields
  incorrectly filled or skipped.
* Breaking the analog-digital barrier multiple times is costly and error prone:
  GPS, PIT tag reader, barcodes for samples etc.
* Associating media to records is labourious and error-prone

Digitising a paper data sheet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Data collected on paper has to be read (interpreting handwriting correctly),
mentally mapped from datasheet to electronic form, and typed off (correctly) by
the data entry operator.

Proof-reading a digital record against paper data sheet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A second person, acting as proofreader, has to reproduce the same mental effort
to map the paper data sheet to the electronic form and correct any errors they find.


Digital data collection
-----------------------
Digital forms can offer dropdown menus with pre-defined values to reduce sources
of error.

Digital data capture devices can reliably and easily record and associate
location and take photos. Compare pressing a "record location" button to taking
a GPS point, reading, understanding, typing, and confirming 15 digits under time
pressure, sleep deprivation and harsh environmental conditions.

Data collected digitally enters the system as "proofread", eliminating two laborious
and error-prone steps requiring human interaction.
In addition, the data is available to QA straight away, possibly creating a
tighter error-checking loop.

Re-thinking datasheets
----------------------
Each field in the data sheets has been, and should continue to be questioned:

* Is this information used in any of the analytical outputs?
* Does this information serve any QA purpose?
* Is this information used to derive other information, e.g. deformities being
  used to identify a resighted, untagged animal?
* Will anyone in the foreseeable future require this information?
