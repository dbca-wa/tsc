This chapter addresses data access.

There are four principal ways to access data and derived data products from TSC:

* Data export from GUI: filter to taste, hit "CSV" or "XLS" on the top right.
* Data export from Data Curation Portal: filter to location and date, select all, bottom left menu "export to CSV", export.
* Data export from API: see tscr vignette on data access at the `tscr documentation <https://dbca-wa.github.io/tscr/>`_.
* Automated reporting: Data exports can be generated on an automated schedule and disseminated through e.g. SharePoint with notifications through Teams.

Additional data export pathways for admins:

* Shell: Rancher > pod > shell > fab shell > iPython session.
* Database: Rancher > pod > shell > ./manage.py db_shell > psql session.
